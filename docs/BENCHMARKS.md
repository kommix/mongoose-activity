# Benchmarks

Performance characteristics tested with 100k activities:

- **Sync logging**: ~2ms per operation
- **Async logging**: ~0.1ms per operation (fire-and-forget)
- **Activity feed query**: ~5ms (50 items, properly indexed)
- **Entity history query**: ~3ms (100 items, properly indexed)
- **Memory usage**: <10MB for 100k activities (with efficient indexing)

## Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: All activity data is validated by Mongoose schemas
- **Injection prevention**: Uses parameterized queries, not string concatenation
- **Memory safety**: TTL and manual cleanup prevent unbounded growth
- **Error isolation**: Activity logging failures never crash your application
